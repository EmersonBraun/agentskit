# AGENTS.md

Universal guidance for AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Kiro, Windsurf, Aider, Codex, etc.) working inside this repository.

> If you are an AI agent: read this file top-to-bottom before making changes. All tool-specific config files in this repo point here.

## What AgentsKit is

AgentsKit is the most complete agent toolkit for the JavaScript ecosystem — 14 plug-and-play packages built on one 5 KB core. It covers chat UIs, autonomous runtimes, tools, skills, memory, RAG, observability, sandboxing, and evaluation.

**Status:** `@agentskit/core` is at v1.0.0 (API frozen at the minor level). All other packages are on 0.x tracks and graduate individually per [`docs/STABILITY.md`](./docs/STABILITY.md).

## Non-negotiable rules

1. **`@agentskit/core` stays tiny.** Zero runtime dependencies. Under 10 KB gzipped. Contains only types, events, contracts, and minimal base logic. Any change that adds a dependency or breaks the size budget is rejected by CI — do not try to bypass.
2. **Every package is plug-and-play.** Simple imports, minimal config, clear contracts, independently installable.
3. **Interop is mandatory.** Any combination of packages must compose.
4. **Contracts are pinned to ADRs.** The six core contracts (Adapter, Tool, Memory, Retriever, Skill, Runtime) live in [`docs/architecture/adrs/`](./docs/architecture/adrs/). Changing a contract requires a new ADR + coordinated major bump of affected packages.
5. **v1 stability promise.** Breaking changes to core require a major bump and a deprecation cycle of ≥ 1 minor release.

## Code conventions

- TypeScript **strict mode**. No `any` — use `unknown` and narrow.
- **Named exports only.** No default exports.
- Components are **headless** — no hardcoded styles. Use `data-ak-*` attributes.
- All packages build with **tsup**, dual CJS/ESM output.
- Tests use **vitest**. E2E uses **Playwright**.
- Versioning via **Changesets** (`pnpm changeset`).
- Comments: default to none. Only add when the *why* is non-obvious.

Every package has its own `README.md` + `CONVENTIONS.md`. Read the CONVENTIONS file of the package you're editing before making changes.

## Workflow expectations for agents

- **Plan first for non-trivial changes.** If the task spans multiple packages or touches contracts, produce a plan and get approval before editing.
- **Scope discipline.** A bug fix doesn't need a refactor. A one-shot operation doesn't need a helper. Don't add features the task didn't ask for.
- **Don't touch contracts casually.** Changes in `packages/core/src/` affect every downstream package. If in doubt, don't.
- **Size budgets are enforced.** Before adding to `core`, run `pnpm size` and confirm you're still under budget.
- **Tests are required** for new behavior. Mirror the patterns in the existing test suites.
- **Changesets are required** for user-facing changes. Run `pnpm changeset` and describe the impact honestly.
- **Never skip pre-commit hooks** (`--no-verify`). Fix the underlying issue.
- **Never force-push** to `main` or any shared branch.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm install                           # install all deps
pnpm build                             # build all packages (turbo)
pnpm test                              # run all tests
pnpm lint                              # type-check (tsc --noEmit)
pnpm dev                               # watch mode
pnpm size                              # enforce bundle budgets
pnpm docs                              # Fumadocs dev server
pnpm test:e2e                          # Playwright E2E

pnpm --filter @agentskit/core test     # single package
pnpm changeset                         # create a changeset for your change
```

## Where things are documented

- [Manifesto](./MANIFESTO.md) — the ten principles. Re-read if unsure.
- [ORIGIN](./ORIGIN.md) — why this exists.
- [docs/STABILITY.md](./docs/STABILITY.md) — per-package stability tiers.
- [docs/architecture/adrs/](./docs/architecture/adrs/) — pinned contracts.
- [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) — human contribution workflow.
- [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) — Claude-specific extensions to this file.

## Anti-patterns (do not do these)

- Adding runtime dependencies to `@agentskit/core`.
- Using `any`, adding default exports, or hardcoding styles.
- Making "while I'm here" refactors outside the task scope.
- Leaving dead code, commented-out blocks, or `// TODO: remove later`.
- Writing docstrings that restate what the code already says.
- Bypassing CI gates with skip flags or comment escapes.
- Amending already-pushed commits.
- Generating files into directories the task didn't mention.

If a rule in this file conflicts with a user's explicit instruction in the current conversation, the user wins — but flag the conflict.
