## Overview

| Period | Phase | Issues | Goal |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Weeks 1–6** | **Phase 0** (Foundation) | 52 (#212–#263) | Solid base: contracts, narrative, Fumadocs, agentskit.io, quality |
| **Months 2–4** | **Phase 1** (Foundation UX) | 20 (#114–#133) | DX that goes viral — init, doctor, dev, devtools, recipes |
| **Months 4–7** | **Phase 2** (Evolution) | 31 (#134–#164) | Real technical differentiation — replay, router, memory, security |
| **Months 7–10** | **Phase 3** (Expansion) | 34 (#165–#198) | Adapters, tools, MCP bridge, multi-framework, verticals |
| **Months 10–12** | **Phase 4** (Business) | 12 (#199–#210) | Cloud, marketplace, enterprise, partnerships |

**Total**: ~12 months of a clear roadmap. Mandatory quarterly review to recalibrate.

## Critical dependencies

### Before anything in Phase 1
- ✅ Contract ADRs (#214) completed
- ✅ Bundle/coverage gates (#217 #218) active
- ✅ agentskit.io live (#235)
- ✅ Fumadocs migrated (#238)
- ✅ README + Manifesto + Origin (#224 #225 #226) published
- ✅ E2E Playwright on the examples (#251)

### Feature-to-feature dependencies

```
#3 Contract ADRs ─────┬──> all of Phase 1 (needs a stable contract)
                       └──> all of Phase 3 (new adapters/tools)

#54 MCP bridge (P3) ──> #31 agentskit ai (P2) — needs MCP tools
#21 Deterministic replay (P2) ──> #39 Session replay + #43 Test fixtures
#77 AgentsKit Edge (P3) ──> #86 Cloud free tier (P4) — edge runtime
#69 Skill marketplace (P3) ──> #91 Revenue share (P4)
#81 A2A Protocol (P3) ──> strategic partnerships (P4)
```

### Capacity warnings
- **S16–S18** (memory + security + durability) are **heavy** — consider 3 sprints instead of 2
- **S19 major adapters** requires API keys for 10+ providers — line up budget/credentials first
- **S20 MCP bridge** is architecturally heavy — allocate a senior dev

## Project Board — recommended configuration

Add an **Iteration** field (sprint tracker) with:
- Sprints S1 through S27 as options
- Pre-filled for the next 2–3 iterations

Create **Views**:
1. **🔥 Current Sprint** — filter: `iteration = current`, group by Status
2. **📅 Roadmap Timeline** — layout: Roadmap, group by Phase
3. **🎯 By Priority** — filter: `iteration = current or next`, group by Priority
4. **🧭 Backlog Planning** — filter: `iteration is empty`, group by Phase
5. **📦 By Package** — group by Category/Package

---

## Concrete next actions (start today)

### This week (Sprint 1 start)
1. **Create branch `foundation/manifesto-origin`** — draft MANIFESTO.md + ORIGIN.md
2. **Buy DNS service + Cloudflare for agentskit.io** — point a provisional `CNAME`
3. **Set up `size-limit` on a test package** (core) — validate the flow before replicating
4. **Create issue/PR templates in `.github/`** — unblocks everything that follows
5. **Decide the new docs host**: Vercel vs Cloudflare Pages (we recommend Vercel for the Fumadocs/Next.js integration)

### Next week
1. Finalize MANIFESTO + ORIGIN in an approved PR
2. Start the root README rewrite (block by block)
3. Spike Fumadocs in a separate branch
4. Open the first ADR (`0001-adapter-contract.md`) as a public RFC

### Week 3
1. Parity check Docusaurus vs Fumadocs
2. Continue ADRs (target: 1/day)
3. CODEOWNERS + issue templates merged
4. Activate bundle/coverage gates on main

## Execution principles

1. **Done is better than perfect** — accept v0.1 of things and iterate
2. **Publish in public** — RFCs, ADRs, decisions all open
3. **Aggressive time-boxing** — every task has a limit; if it overruns, re-evaluate
4. **Move at least 1 issue every day** — momentum matters
5. **Never start a phase with the previous one incomplete** — gates exist for a reason
6. **Dogfood** — AgentsKit should be used to build AgentsKit (docs chat, release agent, etc.)
