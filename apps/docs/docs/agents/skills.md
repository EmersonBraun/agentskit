# Skills

`@agentskit/skills` provides five built-in role-based system prompts that turn the agent into a focused specialist. Skills also carry `tools` hints and `delegates` hints so the runtime knows which tools to activate and which sub-agents to wire up automatically.

## Install

```bash
npm install @agentskit/skills
```

## Using a skill

Pass a skill to `runtime.run()` via the `skill` option. The skill's `systemPrompt` replaces the default system prompt, and any tools listed in `skill.tools` are merged into the active tool set.

```ts
import { createRuntime } from '@agentskit/runtime'
import { anthropic } from '@agentskit/adapters'
import { researcher } from '@agentskit/skills'
import { webSearch } from '@agentskit/tools'

const runtime = createRuntime({
  adapter: anthropic({ apiKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY!, model: 'claude-sonnet-4-6' }),
  tools: [webSearch()],
})

const result = await runtime.run(
  'What are the trade-offs between Redis and Memcached?',
  { skill: researcher },
)
```

## Built-in skills

### `researcher`

Methodical web researcher that finds, cross-references, and summarizes information from multiple sources.

- **tools hint:** `['web_search']`
- **delegates:** _(none)_

The researcher breaks questions into sub-queries, searches each independently, cross-references sources, and ends with a confidence assessment.

### `coder`

Software engineer that writes clean, tested, production-ready code following best practices.

- **tools hint:** `['read_file', 'write_file', 'list_directory', 'shell']`
- **delegates:** _(none)_

The coder understands requirements fully before writing, handles edge cases, and explains key design decisions. It never uses `any` types or adds unrequested abstractions.

### `planner`

Strategic planner that breaks complex tasks into steps, identifies dependencies, and coordinates specialist agents.

- **tools hint:** _(none — delegates do the work)_
- **delegates:** `['researcher', 'coder']`

The planner decomposes goals into the smallest independently completable steps and delegates each step to the correct specialist. It replans when a step fails instead of blindly continuing.

### `critic`

Constructive reviewer that evaluates work for correctness, completeness, and quality.

- **tools hint:** `['read_file']`
- **delegates:** _(none)_

The critic categorizes issues by severity (critical / important / minor), provides specific fixes with reasoning, and always acknowledges what works well before listing problems.

### `summarizer`

Concise summarizer that extracts key points while preserving nuance and structure.

- **tools hint:** _(none)_
- **delegates:** _(none)_

The summarizer scales output length to content length: a sentence for short content, structured bullet points for long content. It never introduces information that is not in the original.

## `composeSkills`

Merge two or more skills into one. The resulting skill concatenates all system prompts (separated by `--- name ---` headers), deduplicates tool hints, and merges delegate lists.

```ts
import { composeSkills, researcher, coder } from '@agentskit/skills'

const fullStackAgent = composeSkills(researcher, coder)

const result = await runtime.run(
  'Research the best TypeScript ORM, then scaffold a basic schema',
  { skill: fullStackAgent },
)
```

The composed skill's `name` is `researcher+coder` and its `description` lists both components.

```ts
// Throws — at least one skill is required
composeSkills()

// Single skill passthrough — returns the original unchanged
composeSkills(researcher) // === researcher
```

## `listSkills`

Enumerate all built-in skills and their metadata — useful for building agent UIs or validating configuration.

```ts
import { listSkills } from '@agentskit/skills'

const skills = listSkills()
// [
//   { name: 'researcher', description: '...', tools: ['web_search'], delegates: [] },
//   { name: 'coder',      description: '...', tools: ['read_file', 'write_file', 'list_directory', 'shell'], delegates: [] },
//   { name: 'planner',    description: '...', tools: [], delegates: ['researcher', 'coder'] },
//   { name: 'critic',     description: '...', tools: ['read_file'], delegates: [] },
//   { name: 'summarizer', description: '...', tools: [], delegates: [] },
// ]
```

Each entry is a `SkillMetadata` object:

```ts
interface SkillMetadata {
  name: string
  description: string
  tools: string[]       // Tool names this skill expects to have available
  delegates: string[]   // Sub-agent names this skill will delegate to
}
```

## Bringing your own skill

A `SkillDefinition` is a plain object — no class required.

```ts
import type { SkillDefinition } from '@agentskit/core'

export const translator: SkillDefinition = {
  name: 'translator',
  description: 'Translates text between languages accurately and naturally.',
  systemPrompt: `You are a professional translator...`,
  tools: [],
  delegates: [],
}
```
