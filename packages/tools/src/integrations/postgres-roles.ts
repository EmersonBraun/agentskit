/**
 * Build read-only and (optionally) write postgres tools from one config.
 *
 * Why this exists: a single \`postgres({ allowWrites: true })\` tool gives the
 * agent both read and write capability through the same surface. If the
 * agent gets confused — or prompt-injected — it can write where it meant to
 * read. Splitting them with two separate role-bound clients lets the system
 * enforce least-privilege at the database level, not just at the prompt
 * level.
 *
 * Typical wiring:
 *   - \`readClient\` is connected as a role with \`USAGE\` + \`SELECT\` only,
 *     ideally pointed at a read replica.
 *   - \`writeClient\` is connected as a role with the minimum write
 *     privileges the use case requires, on the primary.
 *
 * Surfaces:
 *   - \`postgres_read\`  — always exposed; refuses anything that isn't a
 *                          \`SELECT\` / \`WITH ... SELECT\` / \`EXPLAIN\`.
 *   - \`postgres_write\` — only exposed when \`writeClient\` is set; allows
 *                          \`INSERT\` / \`UPDATE\` / \`DELETE\` / \`MERGE\`.
